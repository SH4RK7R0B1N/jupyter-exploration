# jupyter-exploration

This repository contains my first Jupyter Notebook exploration lab.
In this lab, I practiced using GitHub and Jupyter Notebook.

I first created a GitHub account, made sure to confirm my email with
the account being used. 

I then clicked on repositories and clicked on "+" to create a new 
one which was this one, that you are currently reading.

And then click on "commit changes."
